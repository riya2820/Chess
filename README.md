# Chess Game in Python

# Overview

Developed using Python 3.9, the game features a text-based user interface that displays the chessboard with traditional chess symbols for each piece. The game supports two players taking turns on the same computer, making moves by specifying the coordinates of the piece they wish to move and the destination square. 
 
# Features

1. Text-based Chessboard: The game board is displayed using Unicode chess symbols, allowing for an intuitive and visually appealing representation of the game state.
2. Two-Player Support: The game is designed for two players to play on the same machine, taking turns to make their moves.
3. Simple Console Interface: Players interact with the game through the console, entering commands to move pieces on the board.
4. Board Initialization: The chessboard is initialized with pieces in their standard positions at the start of the game.
